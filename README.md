# pyc2bytecode-LLM

Decompile Python bytecode with LLM enhancement.

## Why use LLM?

This project uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy and readability of decompiled Python bytecode. LLMs can help:

*   **Understand complex code structures:** LLMs are trained on vast amounts of code and can recognize patterns that traditional decompilers might miss.
*   **Generate more human-readable code:** LLMs can generate code that is easier to understand and maintain.
*   **Improve decompilation accuracy:** LLMs can help to correct errors and fill in gaps in the decompiled code.
